EE 2.X Installation Instructions

1) Copy the 'automin' directory to your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory.

2) In your site's web root, create a folder called 'automin' and give it writeable permissions. You may change the folder name and path in the module settings page.

3) Log in to EE, and click Addons->Modules. Install the AutoMin module. Make sure the settings look correct.

4) Install the AutoMin Template Tags. See the README file for details on this.

5) If all goes well, when you refresh the page your CSS and JavaScript will be combined and minfied! If you have any issues, turn on template debugging in Admin->Output and Debugging. Template debugging will also tell you how much of a savings you got from using AutoMin.

TO ENABLE HTML MARKUP COMPRESSION

1) After following the steps above to install AutoMin, 'copy hooks/automin.php' file to your 'system/expressionengine/hooks' directory.

2) Copy the 'config/hooks.php' file to your 'system/expressionengine/config/' directory. NOTE: If you've already added CodeIgniter hooks to this file, you'll need to manually copy the hook code into your existing hooks.php file. Overwriting that file will uninstall your other hooks. Most users will have no prior hooks installed.

3) Open up your system/expressionengine/config/config.php file and change $config['enable_hooks'] = FALSE; to $config['enable_hooks'] = TRUE; (around line 119).

4) Make sure "Compress HTML Markup" is turned on in AutoMin's module settings.

5) Refresh your page. Your HTML markup should now be compressed.
